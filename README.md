## Introduction

Hello 👋, I'm Nico. I'm a M.Sc. Industrial Engineering Student at Technical University Berlin. I'm interested in Machine and Deep Learning.

My primary focus is on learning and understanding how AI and Data Science applications work, and I am steadily learning Python (especially Pytorch and Numpy) and have learned basics in Java and SQL, which I am looking to improve. I am eager to bring my skills and experience to a new challenge as a working student and to dive deeper into the topic of AI.
