### Introduction

Hello 👋, I'm Nico. I'm a 4th-year M. Sc. Industrial Engineering Student at Techncal University Berlin. I'm interested in Machine and Deep Learning.

My primary focus is on learning and understanding how AI and Data Science applications work, and I am steadily learning Python (especially Pytorch and Numpy) and have learned basics in Java and SQL, which I am looking to improve. I am eager to bring my skills and experience to a new challenge as a working student and to dive deeper into the topic of AI.
